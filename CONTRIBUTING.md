## Linting and Formatting

Lint and format your code using [`ruff`][2]. The easiest way to automate
linting/formatting of code prior to each commit is via the [`pre-commit`][1]
package, which simplifies management of git hooks.

If using pip, `pre-commit` will be installed when you install `ursa` in
editable mode via

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

If using `uv`, `pre-commit` will be installed in your default (dev)
environment.

To install the ruff git hook to your local `.git/hooks` folder, run
the following in the current directory:

```bash
# If using pip with venv, first activate your environment, then
pre-commit install

# If usign uv
uv run pre-commit install
```

Prior to subsequent `git commit` calls, `ruff` will first lint/format code.

Instead of running git hooks, you can lint/format code manually via running the
following in the current directory:

```bash
# Lint
ruff check --fix

# Format
ruff format
```

To continually lint while developing, you can
run the following in your terminal

```bash
ruff check --watch
```

For editor (e.g., vim, VSCode) integration, see [here][4].

(You can install via ruff following instructions [here][3].)

If installing `ruff` instead of using `pre-commit`, please use `ruff~=0.12.10`.
