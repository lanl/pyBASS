[![PyPI Version][pypi-version]](https://pypi.org/project/pybass-emu/)
[![PyPI Downloads][monthly-downloads]](https://pypistats.org/packages/pybass-emu)

A python implementation of Bayesian adaptive spline surfaces (BASS).  Similar
to Bayesian multivariate adaptive regression splines (Bayesian MARS) introduced
in Denison _et al_. (1998).

## Installation
```bash
# pip
pip install pybass-emu

# uv
uv add pybass-emu
```

## Examples
* [Example 1][ex1] - univariate response
* [Example 2][ex2] - multivariate/functional response
